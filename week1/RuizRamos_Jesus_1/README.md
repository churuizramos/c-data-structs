# Programming Assignment Week 1

The program "Sales.cpp" runs with different options. I created it to be able to change the data on the array. Each row on the array is treated as the class ID.
There are 6 functions:

1. Add Sale:
    Increments an N amount at a given location -1 to account for the index.
2. Print Sales:
    Displays all the classes and their total sales.
3. Print Class:
    Displays the sales of one individual class.
4. Save Sales:
    Saves all the data in a "sales.out" file.
5. Load Sales:
    Loads all the data from the "sales.out" file.
6. Print Results:
    Prints which class sold the most boxes and how many.

I know the assignment didn't need this much work but I wanted to challenge myself as I've been recently going back through and learning new functions for C++.
